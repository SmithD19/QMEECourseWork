# Python Notes

# Lists - contains compound data ID by [] brackets
# Tuple - like lists but harder to modify ID by () brackets
# Dictionary - {}
# NumPy Arrays - fast efficient numerical computing

# Indexing in Python starts at 0 not 1

# Each object has methods associated with it. These modify the objects.
MyList = ('blue')
MyList.append('a new item')


# If your elements/data are unordered and indexed by numbers use a list
# If you're defining a constant set of values (or ordered sequences) and all you're ever going to do with them is iterate through them, use a tuple.
# If you want to perform set operations on data, use a set
# If they are unordered and indexed by keys (e.g., names), use a dictionary

# Copying -----

a = b # This gives a another tag - b. This doesnt actually copy any memory jsut assigns a new label
a = b[:] # This does a shallow copy, doesnt go past the first nested list
a = copy.deepcopy(a) # This is a deep copy and is recursive - copying everything

# Strings -----
